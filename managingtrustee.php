                              <p class="margin-15px-bottom justified-text">Though a majority of the educational institutions concentrate their efforts in improving their final results, they have to work on the improvement of other skills as well, due to the following reasons. If we analyse the life of the students in detail we will have to come to the conclusion that their life is highly structured from K.G. to graduation. This is because a majority of the parents are very ambitious about the educational performance of their wards and forcibly send their children to various curricular as well as extra-curricular classes. Naturally, we observe that almost all children are preoccupied with various classes, projects and other related activities every day. Virtually they have no free time for playing or interacting with others in a free atmosphere.</p>
                              <p class="margin-15px-bottom justified-text">Hence they are not able to develop a real and meaningful relationship with other students or even with close relatives. It should be remembered that man is a social animal and the denial of development of social skills will definitely affect him mentally and physically.Hence they are not able to develop a real and meaningful relationship with other students or even with close relatives.

                              <p class="margin-15px-bottom justified-text">It is important that all the educational Institutions should strive hard to develop the social skills of the students along with academic performance. As far as our Institute is concerned, we have laid out our core policy that our aim is for overall development of the students in all fields such as education, culture and sports. Hence we have made it a point to organize the Tarash Festival as an integral part of our curriculum for all the disciplines every year in a big way. It should be realized that this festival is of the students, by the students and for the students. Therefore all the students without exception take part in the various activities concerned with this mass festival and they are able to show their skills in planning, organizing, communicating and in the various other related activities without much help from the Institution. Naturally this festival gives a great opportunity for developing their social skills in particular, and they are able to fine tune their personality. Again we have gone one more step ahead by starting the "Save Tiger Movement" so that our concern for wild life and nature is developed in the early age of the students. We have organized two major rallies i.e. one from Mumbai to Goa(2011) and another from Mumbai to Kolhapur(2012). It is gratifying to note that the students of our college took active part in these rallies and this adds another feather to their cap in our efforts aimed at the overall development of the students. "Well done! Keep it up"</p>
